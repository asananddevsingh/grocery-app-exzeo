This project is developed for "Exzeo" as part of "Code Test". It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirement

You have a GroceryApp class, which receives a list of products, each one with name and votes. The app should render an unordered list, with a list item for each product. Products can be upvoted or downvoted.

By appropriately using React state and props, implement the upvote/downvote logic.

Consider that there is a node service which serves you endpoint for list of products (GET /products) and update votes (POST /upvote, POST /downvote).

### Note: Code should be neat and clean

- There should be proper setup so that anybody can run the application by single line command

- There should some sample for test cases

- Use Redux in your code
